## Considerations

> Firstly I would like to say Thank You for this opportunity. I really enjoyed it and I also could learn a lot working on this project.

## Techs

Regarding the techs, below there are some considerations:

- In my previous jobs, I always use Webpack, but in this project I use Vite, because I thought could be a nice opportunity to understand more about Vite.

- Another nice point about this project, in my previous experience, I used cypress for e2e, but now I use Playwright, because I was studying about it and I could see it is preety simple to use, the configuration is also easy and the community is growing.

- ESLint is an item that I think helpful for projects to keep a good code quality and validation.

- I use Vitest and I learn it during of this challenge. Previously I used Jest.

- I added pagination using infinit scroll with useInfiniteQuery.


## Appoachs

- useCallback and useMemo help me to avoid re-render for my components
- Lazy from react for my pages, it helps me to load my component only when is really necessary. Code Splitting
- I use useInfiniteQuery for my pagination with infinit scroll, it helps me with incremental image loading.
- I thought that accessibility would be an important point and I added it on the project.
- Using slugs for URL params when there is space beteen words like 'Rio de Janeiro' or 'New York'
- App Responsive using breakpoints
- For UX I created ErrorBoundary component, added feedback when there is an error and when content is loading.
- Avoid request when the input is empty.

### Thank You!

If I'm selected for a tech interview, I would love to discuss more about my experience working on this challenge in details.
