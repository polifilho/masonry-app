## Considerations

> Firstly I would like to say Thank You for this opportunity. I really enjoyed it and I also could learn a lot working on this project.

## Techs

Regarding the techs, below there are some considerations:

- In my previous jobs, I always use Webpack, but in this project I use Vite, because I thought could be a nice opportunity to understand more about Vite.

- Another nice point about this project, in my previous experience, I used cypress for e2e, but now I use Playwright, because I was studying about it and I could see it is preety simple to use, the configuration is also easy and the community is growing.

- React Query I already used in other projects, and here I could use the cacche and other benefits.

- ESLint is an item that I think helpful for projects to keep a good code quality and validation.

- I use Vitest and I learn it during of this challenge. Previously I used Jest.


### Thank You!

If I'm selected for a tech interview, I would love to discuss more about my experience working on this challenge in details.
